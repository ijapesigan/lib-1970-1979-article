  abstract = {The actual behaviour of the probability of a Type I error under assumption violation is quite complex, depending upon a wide variety of interacting factors. Yet allegations of robustness tend to ignore its highly particularistic nature and neglect to mention important qualifying conditions. The result is often a vast overgeneralization which nevertheless is difficult to refute since a standard quantitative definition of what constitutes robustness does not exist. Yet under any halfway reasonable quantitative definition, many of the most prevalent claims of robustness would be demonstrably false. Therefore robustness is a highly questionable concept.},

  abstract = {When making sampling distribution inferences about the parameter of the data, $\theta$, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are `missing at random' and the observed data are `observed at random', but these inferences are generally conditional on the observed pattern of missing data. When making direct-likelihood or Bayesian inferences about $\theta$, it is appropriate to ignore the process that causes missing data if the missing data are missing at random and the parameter of the missing data process is `distinct' from $\theta$. These conditions are the weakest general conditions under which ignoring the process that causes missing data always leads to correct inferences.},
